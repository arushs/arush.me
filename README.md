This website is my portfolio website designed and implemented by me.
It is my first web project and includes a lot of experimentation.

##Current Implementation
Currently, the site is just a portfolio site, and thus does not have much of a backend. It uses JQuery to animate logos, but otherewise is purely HTML and CSS.

The site is being hosted on an [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) server, which is running [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) 13.10 server.
I have decided to use [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) along with [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) just to wrap my head around back-end web applicatios. 

##Future Plans
I am redoing the whole website.
It will become a static website hosted on an S3 bukkit. The current style will be completely redone.

##Starting
To start the website, run npm install, then npm start.

##Contact
Any comments are welcome!
